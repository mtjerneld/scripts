You are analyzing Azure governance data for a single tenant. Provide strategic, opinionated recommendations.

## ANALYSIS PROCESS

### Stage 1: Reasoning (Show Your Work)

Before making recommendations, document your critical thinking:

#### A) Cost Recommendation Analysis
- List all cost recommendations by resource
- Identify overlapping/mutually exclusive options (RI vs Savings Plan for same resource)
- For each resource with multiple options:
  - Compare: Which option is ACTUALLY better and why?
  - Calculate: What are the REAL savings (not additive sum)?
  - Decide: What's the single best recommendation?
- Deduplicate: Same recommendation with different lookback periods = one opportunity
- Calculate: True total potential savings (no double-counting)

#### B) Security Risk Filtering
- Separate Critical findings into:
  - **Real Critical**: Internet-exposed, data at risk, active exploitation vectors
  - **Important**: Compliance gaps, defense-in-depth improvements
  - **Noise**: Low-risk compliance checkboxes, informational findings
- For each Critical/High finding, assess:
  - What's the actual exploitation scenario?
  - What's the business impact if exploited?
  - Is this internet-facing or internal?
- Flag findings that are compliance theater vs real risk

#### C) Implementation Dependencies
- What must be done first? (e.g., Bastion before disabling RDP)
- What conflicts? (e.g., can't do X and Y simultaneously)
- What requires architecture changes vs configuration tweaks?

#### D) Data Quality Assessment
- What's missing from the data?
- What assumptions are you making?
- Where is there uncertainty?

**Document your reasoning above before proceeding to recommendations.**

### Stage 2: Recommendations (Final Output)

Now provide your analysis in the following structured format:

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**2-3 bullets maximum. Only include items that are:**
- Critical risk OR high financial impact
- Immediately actionable
- Have clear business consequence

## CRITICAL ACTIONS

**Maximum 5 items. These are non-negotiable must-dos.**

For each action:
- Resource/Service and specific issue
- WHY this matters (risk × impact analysis)
- Recommended action (specific, not generic)
- Timeline (days/weeks, be realistic)
- Expected outcome (quantified if possible)
- What happens if we DON'T do this

**Prioritization logic: Why these 5 vs everything else in the data?**

## COST OPTIMIZATION

### Best Opportunities (Deduplicated)
For each opportunity:
- Resource identification
- Single best option (RI 1Y vs RI 3Y vs Savings Plan - pick ONE)
- Annual savings (true number, not additive sum)
- Trade-off explanation (why this option vs alternatives)
- Implementation complexity and timeline
- Confidence level (High/Medium/Low)

**Total Potential Savings: [Deduplicated sum]**

### Cost Optimization Notes
- Explain any conflicting recommendations you resolved
- Note any overlapping opportunities you combined
- Highlight any uncertainty in savings estimates

## SECURITY & COMPLIANCE

### Immediate Risks (This Week)
- Only TRUE critical risks (internet exposure, data leakage, active attack vectors)
- Explain WHY each is critical vs merely "high severity"

### Important Improvements (This Month)
- High-impact security posture improvements
- Compliance gaps with business impact

### Lower Priority (This Quarter)
- Defense-in-depth enhancements
- Compliance checkbox items
- Informational findings

**Note items you explicitly de-prioritized and why.**

## INFRASTRUCTURE HEALTH

### Urgent (30 days)
- End-of-life items with retirement dates
- Backup gaps for critical workloads
- Immediate availability risks

### Important (90 days)
- Upcoming EOL items
- RBAC hygiene
- Technical debt

## KEY INSIGHTS

**3-5 bullets:**
- Patterns observed in this tenant
- Resources with multiple compounding issues
- Architecture or governance recommendations
- Proactive improvements to prevent future issues

## RECOMMENDATIONS REJECTED OR DEPRIORITIZED

**Document what you explicitly chose NOT to include and why:**
- Low-value recommendations filtered out
- Findings that are noise vs signal
- Items blocked by other priorities
- Uncertain or incomplete data points

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
- Reserved Instances and Savings Plans are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE - choose one, don't sum both
- Multiple lookback period recommendations = one opportunity evaluated two ways
- Not all "Critical" findings are equally critical - assess real risk
- Be opinionated - make calls and explain trade-offs
- Focus on signal over noise - less is more
- Show your reasoning in Stage 1, then provide clean recommendations in Stage 2
