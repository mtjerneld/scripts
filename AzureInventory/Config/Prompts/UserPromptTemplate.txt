You are analyzing Azure governance data for a single tenant across FOUR governance domains:
1. Cost Optimization
2. Security & Compliance  
3. Infrastructure Operations (EOL, Backup, Changes)
4. RBAC Governance

Provide strategic, opinionated recommendations across ALL four domains.

## ANALYSIS PROCESS

### Stage 1: Reasoning (Show Your Work Across All Domains)

Before making recommendations, document your critical thinking for EACH domain:

#### A) Cost Recommendation Analysis
- List all cost recommendations by resource
- Identify overlapping/mutually exclusive options (RI vs Savings Plan for same resource)
- For each resource with multiple options:
  - Compare: Which option is ACTUALLY better and why?
  - Calculate: What are the REAL savings (not additive sum)?
  - Decide: What's the single best recommendation?
- Deduplicate: Same recommendation with different lookback periods = one opportunity
- Calculate: True total potential savings (no double-counting)
- Analyse cost_trends, top_spenders, by_category, by_subscription to draw insights. We are looking for things that require our attention.

#### B) Security Risk Filtering
- Separate Critical findings into:
  - **Real Critical**: Internet-exposed, data at risk, active exploitation vectors
  - **Important**: Compliance gaps, defense-in-depth improvements
  - **Noise**: Low-risk compliance checkboxes, informational findings
- For each Critical/High finding, assess:
  - What's the actual exploitation scenario?
  - What's the business impact if exploited?
  - Is this internet-facing or internal?
- Flag findings that are compliance theater vs real risk

#### C) Infrastructure Operations Analysis
- **EOL Remediation:**
  - <90 days to retirement: CRITICAL (list these)
  - <180 days to retirement: IMPORTANT (summarize count)
  - >180 days: Planning phase (note for future)
- **Backup Coverage:**
  - VMs without backup: Categorize by criticality (production vs dev)
  - Running backups are more important than Deallocated ones
  - Check for "health_status" != "Passed", this can incidate backup problems
  - Calculate backup coverage percentage
  - Identify business continuity risks
  - Look for names like Prod, Test, PreProd, Lab etc. to evaluate backup priority (both in VM and Subscription names)
- **Change Analysis:**
  - Security-relevant changes: Flag IAM, network, storage security changes
  - High-impact changes: Resource deletions, major config changes
  - Especially focus on creations and deletions performed by Users.
  - Noise vs signal: Filter routine operational changes
  **Network Analysis:**
  - Subnets not secured by NSG:s
  - Disconnected Connections (Peerings, S2S, ER)
  - Security issues found

#### D) RBAC Governance Analysis
- **Privileged Access Patterns:**
  - Owner/Contributor at subscription level: High risk (list these)
  - Owner/Contributor at management group/root: CRITICAL risk
  - Service principals with elevated roles: Assess risk
- **Redundant Assignments:**
  - Where multiple overlapping roles exist (explain why redundant)
  - Audit complexity from over-assignment
- **Access Review Needs:**
  - Stale assignments (how many need review?)
  - Guest users with privileged roles
  - Service principals without owners

#### E) Cross-Domain Analysis
- Resources with issues across multiple domains (e.g., EOL + expensive + insecure)
- Dependencies: What must be fixed first to enable other fixes?
- Compounding risks: Multiple issues on same resource = higher priority

#### F) Data Quality Assessment
- What's missing from the data?
- What assumptions are you making?
- Where is there uncertainty?

**Document your reasoning above before proceeding to recommendations.**

### Stage 2: Recommendations (Final Output - All Domains)

Now provide your analysis in the following structured format:

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Maximum 5 bullets covering all four domains:**
- Critical cost optimization opportunity
- Most urgent security risk
- Critical infrastructure issue (EOL, backup, or change)
- Highest-risk RBAC finding
- Overall tenant health assessment

## CRITICAL ACTIONS

**Maximum 7 items across all four domains. These are non-negotiable must-dos.**

For each action (label the domain: [COST], [SECURITY], [INFRA], [RBAC]):
- Resource/Service and specific issue
- WHY this matters (risk × impact analysis)
- Recommended action (specific, not generic)
- Timeline (days/weeks, be realistic)
- Expected outcome (quantified if possible)
- What happens if we DON'T do this

**Prioritization logic: Why these items vs everything else in the data?**

## DOMAIN-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. COST OPTIMIZATION

#### Best Opportunities (Deduplicated)
For each opportunity:
- Resource identification
- Single best option (RI 1Y vs RI 3Y vs Savings Plan - pick ONE)
- Annual savings (true number, not additive sum)
- Trade-off explanation (why this option vs alternatives)
- Implementation complexity and timeline
- Confidence level (High/Medium/Low)

**Total Potential Savings: [Deduplicated sum]**

#### Cost Optimization Notes
- Explain any conflicting recommendations you resolved
- Note any overlapping opportunities you combined
- Highlight any uncertainty in savings estimates

---

### 2. SECURITY & COMPLIANCE

#### Immediate Risks (This Week)
- Only TRUE critical risks (internet exposure, data leakage, active attack vectors)
- Explain WHY each is critical vs merely "high severity"

#### Important Improvements (This Month)
- High-impact security posture improvements
- Compliance gaps with business impact

#### Lower Priority (This Quarter)
- Defense-in-depth enhancements
- Compliance checkbox items

**Current Compliance Score: [X%]**  
**Critical Findings: [N]** | **High Findings: [N]**

### 3. INFRASTRUCTURE OPERATIONS

#### A) End-of-Life Remediation

**Critical (<30 days):**
- List resources retiring within 30 days with specific retirement dates
- Business impact of each

**Important (<90 days):**
- Count and categorize resources retiring within 90 days
- Prioritized by business criticality

**Planning (>90 days):**
- Note count for future planning

#### B) Backup Coverage

- Total VMs: [N]
- Protected VMs: [N]
- Backup Coverage: [X%]

**Gaps Requiring Immediate Attention:**

## CROSS-DOMAIN INSIGHTS

**Resources with Multiple Issues:**
- Identify resources appearing in multiple domains (e.g., "VM-X is EOL, expensive, and insecure")
- Explain compounding risk and priority

**Tenant-Wide Patterns:**
- 3-5 bullets on patterns observed across domains
- Architectural or governance themes
- Proactive improvements to prevent future issues

**Quick Wins Across Domains:**
- Low-effort, high-impact actions spanning multiple domains

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS REJECTED OR DEPRIORITIZED

**Document what you explicitly chose NOT to include and why:**
- Low-value recommendations filtered out (by domain)
- Findings that are noise vs signal
- Items blocked by other priorities
- Uncertain or incomplete data points
- Explain filtering decisions for transparency

---

## GOVERNANCE DATA:
{{GOVERNANCE_DATA_JSON}}

---

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
- Analyze ALL FOUR domains comprehensively (Cost, Security, Infrastructure, RBAC)
- Reserved Instances and Savings Plans are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE - choose one, don't sum both
- Multiple lookback period recommendations = one opportunity evaluated two ways
- Not all "Critical" findings are equally critical - assess real risk
- EOL <30 days = critical, <90 days = important
- Backup gaps for production = critical risk
- Privileged access at subscription/root = high risk
- Be opinionated - make calls and explain trade-offs
- Show your reasoning in Stage 1 for ALL domains, then provide clean recommendations in Stage 2
- Balance attention across all four domains - don't overweight one area
